Reading the source of a project call Raygun on github I noticed that it was uses std library
modules such as chrono without including the header explicitly. It turns out it is doing this
using precompiled headers. 

The file Raygun/pch.h (pch = pre-compiled header I am guessing) is precompiled on this line in
CMakeLists.txt,
 https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Raygun/blob/f6be537c835976a9d6cc356ebe187feba6592847/CMakeLists.txt#L63

Info on precompiled headers with CMake,
  https://cmake.org/cmake/help/git-stage/command/target_precompile_headers.html

The result is that all translation units will ultimately have the header included in them.

The purpose of precompiling is to speed up compilation times.

TODO: test this myself on a project.
