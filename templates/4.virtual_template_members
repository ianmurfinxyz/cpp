VIRTUAL TEMPLATE MEMBER FUNCTIONS
---------------------------------

On P679 section 23.4.6.2 Bjarne points out that a template class cannot have templated virtual
member functions like,

class Shape {

  /* pure virtual template member function.
   *
   */
  template<typename T>
    virtual bool interesect(const T&) const = 0;

};

such a thing is not allowed because it would mean adding a new interesect function for every
time you called interesect with a new argument type. Which Bjarne states would make the
implementation of Linkers unacceptably complicated.

Another thing worth remembering.
